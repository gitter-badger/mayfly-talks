== Dockerize your user stories

== Problems

* Central test environment
* Multiple teams in single codebase
* Merge conflicts on `master`
* Unstable `master`

* What's the problem that Mayfly solves?
** Central test environment
** Multiple teams in single codebase
** Merge conflicts on `master`
** Unstable `master`
--

== Principles

* Continuous Delivery
* `master` == production
* Stories are short-lived

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* What principles does Mayfly follow, enforce, ...?
** continuous delivery
*** no complete integration tests, unless production
** Master is production
** stories are short-lived
--

=== Everything-as-code

* Tests as code
* Environments as code
* Build pipelines as code
* Definition of Done as code

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Tests as code, in the sense that
you want your tests to be automated.

== Demo time

As a user, +
When I start working on a story, +
Then .. +
link:{imagesdir}/20140724-mayfly-story-flow-demo.mp4[demo video]

== What happened?

image::mayfly-open-story-flow.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
. Jira:
** Create story
** Story -> in-progress
. Grimm creates for story:
** feature branch
** Jenkins pipeline
** environment
--

=== And if I make a change?

image::mayfly-make-change-flow.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
. Stash:
** Sends notification to Mayfly
** Sends notification to Jenkins
. Mayfly:
** fetches latest Definition of Done
. Jenkins
** Triggers pipeline for story
** Pushed Docker image to registry
** Sends notification to Mayfly about pipeline state
. Mayfly, on pipeline state notification:
** Triggers deployment of new version on story environment
** Verifies latest Definition of Done state
--

=== And if I resolve my story?

image::mayfly-resolve-story-flow.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
. Jira:
** Resolve story as fixed
** Sends notification to Mayfly
. Mayfly:
** Verifies if Definition of Done is completely OK
** If so,
*** Merge change to `master`
*** Deploy Docker image to production
*** Story environment is removed
*** Feature branch is removed
*** Jenkins pipeline is removed
--

=== But what about conflicts on `master`?

== Mayfly architecture

* Grimm, coordinates the building of stories
* Heimdall, decides if you may deploy your story to Production
* Mario, lays the pipes for your story
* Maxis, creates your story environment
* Ratatouille, the rat called git
* Devision, Jira plugin
* Mayfly-Stash, Stash plugin

=== Stack

* Jira
* Stash
* Jenkins with JobDSL
* Mesos with Marathon
* Docker
* ActiveMQ
* Spring Framework
* Java

== Current state

* Early development
* Scope limited to simple services
* Usage
** 3 team services
** (5) Mayfly services +
   (eat our own dogfood)

== Future

* DB support; oracle, mongodb, ...
* Add more team services
* Working towards production ready
* Open source

== Mayfly
